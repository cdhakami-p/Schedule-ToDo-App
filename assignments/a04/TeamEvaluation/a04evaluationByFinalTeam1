FEEDBACK FOR TEAM 13 (UPDATED DOCS): 


Document Evaluation:

(Updated)
Wireframe Diagram:
- Is the edit event view the same as the create one?

Use-Case Diagram:
- Looks good

Class Diagram:
- What data types are being used for start and end time?
- Where are the views, what attribute do they have?

Activity Diagram:
- Can the day blocks be tapped from the weekly view the way they can be in the monthly?
- Can the events be tapped from the weekly view the way they can be in the daily?

General Comments:
- Consider adding updated dates and app title to documentation files, I believe it is required in all.
