FEEDBACK FOR TEAM 25: 

Use-Case Diagram:
- What does Play Game consist of? 
- What are some of the functions it runs?
- Are there any other actors besides the user?

Class Diagram:
- View elements are isolated, each view should have its own box with those elements (ex: UIBUtton) inside.
- Could you add the frameworks into the diagram?

Activity Diagram:
- The get instructions action isn't represented

Wireframe Diagram:
- Could you also document the frameworks (Notification & MapKit?)?

In general:
- Where would ARKit fit into the UML documentation? It is mentioned in the game description
  but no where else.
- What are the dimensions of the grid in real life?
- What is your second framework from class? MapKit?
